## 💼 About Me

I am a motivated and versatile professional with a background in physical education and personnel management. While my previous experiences have been fulfilling, I have long been drawn to the rapidly-evolving field of software development. As a result, I pursued a professional degree in Full-Stack Software Development, where I am honing my talents in web development, programming, and other cutting-edge technologies.

In my free time, I enjoy creating content for social media platforms like TikTok, composing music, and producing drone videos for my YouTube channel. I'm a former member of Ukraine's Olympic rowing team, have achieved multiple Ukrainian championships, and am a Candidate for Master of Sports.
